# Surfs Up

## Overview
For this analysis, I was tasked with analyzing weather patterns on the Hawaiian island of Oahu.  W. Avy wants to open a surf and ice cream shop on the island, and asked me to look at the temperature data for Oahu during the months of June and December, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year round.  For this analysis, I used Python to access a SQLite database and ran statistical analysis on the temprature data for those two months.

## Results
